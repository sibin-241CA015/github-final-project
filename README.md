# Simple Interest Calculator

This project calculates **Simple Interest** using a shell script.

## Formula
Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time (in years)

## How it Works
The script takes principal, rate, and time as input and calculates the simple interest.

## Example
If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
Simple Interest = 100

## Usage
Run the script and enter the required values when prompted.
